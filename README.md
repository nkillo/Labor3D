3D Vulkan Voxel Engine (Experimental)

This repository will not compile as-is. Large asset folders were intentionally omitted.

The code contains ~2 years of experimental engine work, including: 
Vulkan rendering,
Voxel systems,
Skeletal animation, 
Basic 3D collision/physics, 
Reliable UDP networking tests

All systems are written from scratch in C/C++. This repository is intended for reading and learning.

Questions about specific systems are welcome.
